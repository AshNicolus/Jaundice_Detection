# Jaundice_Detection

Jaundice is a medical condition characterized by the yellowing of the skin and eyes, caused by high bilirubin levels in the blood. This project aims to develop a Python-based tool for detecting jaundice using image processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide a reliable and efficient method for early detection, which can be particularly useful in remote or under-resourced areas.
